# data_exploration-wine_quality

In this project I performed exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing chemical characteristics and ratings for red wines. The goal 
of this analysis is to draw conclusions though univariate, bivariate and multivariate plots with R.

## Getting Started

This project is informational and does not require you to run any code. This project is meant to display the analysis I conducted on 
the data I gathered.
